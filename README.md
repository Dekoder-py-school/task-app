## AI DISCLAIMER
AI (GitHub Copilot) was used to help write the readme, some commit messages, and the menu prompt. It also helped with some debugging and with the displaying of the checkboxes ( [ ] or [X])

The rest of the code was written by me, including the logic for adding, removing, and displaying tasks, as well as accessing the database.
